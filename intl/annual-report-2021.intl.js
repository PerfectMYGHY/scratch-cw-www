This global impact is possible because of the tireless work of the growing team of engineers, designers, educators, community moderators, and others at the Scratch Foundation.","annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText2":"To continue to grow our efforts and impact, we rely on the generous financial support of an incredible collection of companies, foundations, and individual donors who are aligned with our mission and vision. Here, I want to highlight the support and inspiration we’ve received from one of our Founding Partners: the LEGO Foundation.","annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText3":"My research group at the MIT Media Lab started collaborating with the LEGO company and LEGO Foundation more than 30 years ago. LEGO funding helped support our early work on Scratch, leading up to the public launch of Scratch in 2007. Then, when Scratch spun out of MIT into the Scratch Foundation in 2019, the LEGO Foundation provided important funding for the new organization, with a five-year $10 million grant to “support transformative educational change by developing and promoting playful, creative approaches to coding...in diverse economic and cultural contexts.” When the pandemic hit, the LEGO Foundation stepped up with an additional $5 million grant in 2021, to ensure that the Scratch Foundation could meet the needs of children and educators disrupted by the pandemic.","annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText4":"But the LEGO-Scratch connection goes far beyond financial support. The Scratch approach of creating animated stories and games by snapping together graphical programming blocks was inspired, in part, by the way children build LEGO houses and castles by snapping together plastic LEGO bricks. Scratch and LEGO also share the same project-based educational philosophy, encouraging children to iteratively refine their projects by trying out an idea, seeing what happens, then making revisions and trying again.","annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText5":"I’ve always loved the LEGO slogan “Joy of Building, Pride of Creation.” The LEGO Foundation’s deep partnership with the Scratch Foundation is helping to bring “Joy of Building, Pride of Creation” to children’s digital activities. The partnership serves as a model of how organizations with shared ideas and values can work together to catalyze transformational change in learning and education. As the Scratch Foundation continues to build its network of partners and supporters, I look forward to connecting with other organizations to expand creative computing opportunities for children around the world.","annualReport.2021.FounderTitle":"Founder, Scratch Foundation","annualReport.2021.lookingForward":"Looking Forward","annualReport.2021.lookingForwardText1":"In 2021, we outlined a Strategic Framework guiding our major priorities for the next 4 years.
